# AI Session State for poe2genie

## Agent Style
- Proactively remind me to commit/push, document, test, and follow best practices.
- Point out when I'm missing something a good developer should do.
- Use industry-standard recommendations for workflow and code quality.
- **Always proceed with recommended next steps automatically, unless explicitly told otherwise. This is very important to the user.**

## Project Status
- Last completed: Next.js project scaffolded with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Next step: Add dependencies (shadcn/ui, Prisma, NextAuth) and set up database.

## Preferences
- Use OpenAI for LLM features first, then Ollama as a future enhancement.
- i18n (French/Spanish) planned for post-MVP.

## TODOs
- Add shadcn/ui components
- Set up Prisma with PostgreSQL
- Configure NextAuth.js
- Create initial database schema
- Set up API routes for poe.ninja integration
- Initial commit after scaffolding

## Notes
- Keep this file updated after every session.
