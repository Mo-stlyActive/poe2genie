# AI Session State for poe2genie

## Agent Style
- Proactively remind me to commit/push, document, test, and follow best practices.
- Point out when I'm missing something a good developer should do.
- Use industry-standard recommendations for workflow and code quality.
- **Always proceed with recommended next steps automatically, unless explicitly told otherwise. This is very important to the user.**
- **REMINDER: Always suggest committing/pushing to GitHub after completing major features.**

## Project Status
- Last completed: Build planner with searchable equipment and item search functionality.
- Current features: Item search, item details, build planner, build viewer, poe.ninja API integration.
