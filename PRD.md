# poe2genie: Path of Exile 2 Build & Trade AI Helper

## About the Developer
I am a software developer with a background in tech-ed, having worked in the field for 5 years after graduating in software development. I am now pivoting to AI-driven development, aiming to leverage modern AI tools and frameworks to build real-world, scalable applications. My goal is to secure a software development position in Europe, particularly in Valencia (Spain) or Brussels (Belgium). This project is designed as a showcase of my ability to use AI agents and modern technologies to deliver impactful solutions, while keeping costs minimal.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project Name
poe2genie: Path of Exile 2 Build & Trade AI Helper

### Target Users
- Path of Exile players (new and experienced)
- Players interested in trading, build planning, and learning game mechanics

### Core Features (MVP)
1. **Item Search & Trade Value Lookup**
   - Search for items by name/type
   - View current trade values (via poe.ninja API)
   - View item details

2. **Build Planner & Sharing**
   - Create and save builds (start simple: text or basic form)
   - Share builds via link

3. **AI Tools**
   - **Item/Build Description Generator:** LLM generates human-readable explanations/tips
   - **Build Advisor:** LLM suggests builds or improvements based on user input
   - **Search Query Enhancer:** LLM interprets natural language queries and applies filters
   - **FAQ/Help Chatbot:** LLM answers PoE-related questions

### Future Features (Post-MVP)
- User authentication and profiles
- Advanced build planner (visual skill tree, item import)
- Trade tracking and notifications
- Community features (comments, ratings)
- More advanced AI integrations (e.g., personalized recommendations)
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Add support for French and Spanish (and possibly other languages) to make the app accessible to a wider European audience and demonstrate global readiness.

### User Stories
- As a player, I want to search for items and see their current trade value.
- As a player, I want to get an explanation of what an item or build does.
- As a player, I want to input my playstyle and get build suggestions.
- As a player, I want to ask questions about PoE and get instant answers.
- As a player, I want to save and share my builds with others.

### Success Criteria
- Users can search for items and see up-to-date prices.
- Users can generate AI-powered explanations for items/builds.
- Users can get build advice from the AI.
- Users can use natural language to search for items/builds.
- Users can interact with an AI chatbot for PoE questions.

### Non-Goals
- Real-time in-game integration
- Full-featured trade platform (focus is on helper tools, not replacing official trade)

### Design/UX Principles
- Clean, modern, and responsive UI
- Fast and intuitive search
- Clear separation between AI-generated and official data
- Accessibility and mobile-friendly

---

## Future Enhancement: Internationalization (i18n)
- **Goal:** Add support for French and Spanish (at minimum) to make the app accessible to a wider European audience and demonstrate internationalization skills.
- **Approach:** Use a library like `next-i18next` for Next.js. Store translations in JSON files (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`, `es.json`).
- **Timing:** Planned as a post-MVP enhancement, after core features are stable.
- **Benefits:**
  - Broader audience reach
  - Professional polish
  - Highly relevant for European job market
- **Effort:**
  - Initial setup: 1â€“2 days
  - Ongoing: Add translations for new features as needed

---

## Notes
- This project is designed to be as cost-effective as possible, leveraging free tiers and open-source tools.
- AI features will start with OpenAI API and may migrate to open-source LLMs for zero-cost operation in the future.
- Internationalization is a planned enhancement to further increase the project's value for European employers.

## Vision
A modern, AI-powered Path of Exile 2 build & trade helper, with a focus on extensibility, modularity, and a beautiful, PoE-inspired UI.

## Features (Current)
- Modern, dark UI with purple/orange color palette
- CORS proxy for poe.ninja API requests
- Item search across all item types and leagues
- Dedicated item details page
